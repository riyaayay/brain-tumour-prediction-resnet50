Built a convolutional neural network using ResNet50 to classify brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor) from MRI scans.

  -  Developed a ResNet50-based deep learning model in PyTorch to classify brain tumors, achieving 98.32% test accuracy.
  -  Engineered a modular training pipeline with AdamW optimizer, checkpointing, and fast data loaders.
  -  Automated large-scale batch inference and generated detailed per-class performance reports.
